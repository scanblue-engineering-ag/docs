## We have standards

<!--truncate-->

There has been a lot of internal discussions on players and file formats and I hope we will not stop it. Uli the head of the marketing department is very passionate about this topic and pushing us. So are our product owners Mark Röver and Lisalotte Zimmermann. When I quit my job at Microsoft I wrote:

> I am looking forward to the challenge of entering the still early market of Mixed Reality and taking more responsibilities. Scanblue is part of this growing ecosystem and therefor part of shaping the future of computing. I believe that we are a strategic partner in the digital transformation of products and real world objects towards an immersive Mixed Reality experience.

Now I would reconsider and say [XR](https://www.khronos.org/openxr/) instead of Mixed Reality since the market is changing faster and we see more and more trends. 

As scanblue we take the risks and adopt new technologies in the space of three dimensional space in computer science and especially the challenges in computer graphics and computer vision early on. We do this so our customers can profit from our expertise. 

**Now our challenge is to bring immersive experiences and easy to use technologies to our customers and their clients.**

I personally don´t think that the boundaries of apps or tailor made solutions are always the right answer. They maybe but more often then not they are not a way to scale businesses and audiences around the globe. That is why I believe in the internet and the standard group for 3d in the internet is the Khronos group. 

## Khronos Group

With [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/) and [GLTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) a Runtime 3D Asset Delivery the Khronos group is the foundation for 3d on the internet. 

<img src="https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/ceimg/made/assets/uploads/apis/glTF_100px_June16_150_75.png">

>glTF™ (GL Transmission Format) is a royalty-free specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications. glTF minimizes both the size of 3D assets, and the runtime processing needed to unpack and use those assets. glTF defines an extensible, common publishing format for 3D content tools and services that streamlines authoring workflows and enables interoperable use of content across the industry.

## Our commitment

We are commiting to the gltf standard by making it our default file format. More than this, we are putting GLTF as a center peace for all our future work in the engineering and quality assurance. With Martin Franke we have a subject matter expert in the field of GLTF and I am happy to have him as a adivsor and leader of the 3d quality assurance. 

What does this mean? Well our future default file format will be GLTF and we are depricating SPX. What does this mean for our existing customers? Well, nothing - all SPX applications and shipments will stay as is. But we won´t invest in SPX in the future. We will put our resources and investments together into GLTF and take the challenges and chances this brings. 

Now we will do this in two phases. 

Phase one is to support all mobile devices via a unified player experience. We will offer several services to get the best out of the new technology in terms of file size, converters and delivery of three dimensional objects. 

The second phase is clear commitment to the Khronos Group we will start the conversations in 2020.
